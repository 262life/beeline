k8s_shortcuts turns a simple container instanciation into a power support tool for general troubleshooting, service rendering, and performance evaluation.  It does this by creating a core set services that house and manage the utilities as well as a super lightweight container to invoke in a pod.

k8s_shortcuts integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

For more details about the solutions currently supported by k8s_shortcuts, please refer to the [project status section](#project-status) below.
We plan to continue adding support for many common functions required based on community demand and engagement in future releases. See our [roadmap](https://bobdotme.github.io/bob/#!road.md) for more details.
